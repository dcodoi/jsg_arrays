Array Exercise for the java study group 07/04/22

ArrayList is a part of the collection framework. It is present in the java.util package and provides us dynamic arrays in Java. Though, it may be slower than standard arrays but can be helpful in programs where lots of manipulation in the array is needed. We can dynamically add and remove items. It automatically resizes itself.

LinkedList is a linear data structure where the elements are not stored in contiguous locations and every element is a separate object with a data part and address part. The elements are linked using pointers and addresses. Each element is known as a node. Due to the dynamicity and ease of insertions and deletions, they are preferred over the arrays.
